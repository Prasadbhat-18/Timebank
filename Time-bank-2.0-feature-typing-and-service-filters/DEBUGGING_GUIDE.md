# 🔧 Debugging Guide - All Buttons Fixed with Enhanced Logging

## ✅ Enhanced Debugging Added

I've added comprehensive console logging to all the core functions to help identify any issues:

- **Location**: `ServiceModal.tsx` → `handleSubmit` function
- **Debug Logs**: 
  - `📝 ServiceModal handleSubmit called`
  - `👤 User: [user object]`
  - `✅ Form validation passed`
  - `📋 Form data: [form data]`
  - `Creating service with data: [service data]`
  - `Service created successfully: [new service]`

### 🗑️ **Service Deletion (Cancel Service)**
- **Location**: `dataService.ts` → `deleteService` function
- **Debug Logs**:
  - `🗑️ dataService.deleteService called with ID: [serviceId]`
  - `🔍 Found service at index: [index]`
  - `✅ Service deleted from localStorage`
  - `✅ Service deleted from Firestore`

### ⭐ **Review Creation (Leave Review)**
- **Location**: `dataService.ts` → `createReview` function
- **Debug Logs**:
  - `⭐ dataService.createReview called with: [review data]`
  - `✅ Review saved to localStorage`

### 🚨 **SOS Button**
- **Location**: `SOSButton.tsx` → `handleSOSActivation` function
- **Debug Logs**:
  - `SOS activation started`
  - `Triggering SOS actions...`
  - `🚨 SOS ACTIVATED: [location message]`
  - `Location copied to clipboard`
